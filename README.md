# SportStretch

## Description
SportStretch is a Mobile Application that connects professional athletes with legitimate bodywork professionals based on location. 
This enables athletes to avail the services of Licensed Massage Therapists (LMT's) on the go. 
Athletes travel a lot for games and they might be in need of specialized massage services during their travel or while they are at their game. 
The mobile application is created primarily to benefit athletes and therapists with a focus on sport related massage services to be made available on the go.
Eventually SportStretch will be available to Sports Chiropractors, Sports Acupuncturists etc.
